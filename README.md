Steroid horomones produced by the adrenal cortext are physiologically important messengers. The goal of this research is to understand the gene regulatory mechanism underlying steroid hormone metabolism by quantifying RNA metabolism. The experiments are designed quantifying the rates of indvidual steps of RNA metabolism in human H295R cells dueing a timecourse response to a steroidogenic stimulus. This relies on the combination of biochemical methods coupled to RNA-sequencing methods followed by principled computational analysis. We quantify RNA regulatory proceses using metabolic labeling of RNA and ribosome profiling.
